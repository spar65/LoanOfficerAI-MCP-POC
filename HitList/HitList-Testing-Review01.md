# LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC Testing Review

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive review of the test cases in the LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC project. The goal is to identify which tests are essential to maintain (MCP-driven tests) and which ones can be removed (API-driven tests that don't directly test MCP functionality).

## Test Categories

### Core MCP Function Tests (Keep)

These tests directly validate the MCP functionality and should be maintained:

1. **Basic Loan Information MCP Tests**

   - `test-basic-loan-info.js` - Tests the core loan information MCP functions:
     - getLoanDetails
     - getBorrowerDetails
     - getActiveLoans
     - getLoansByBorrower
     - getLoanSummary
     - OpenAI function calling integration

2. **Risk Assessment MCP Tests**

   - `test-risk-assessment-combined.js` - Tests risk assessment MCP functions:
     - getBorrowerDefaultRisk
     - evaluateNonAccrualRisk
     - identifyHighRiskFarmers
     - evaluateCollateralSufficiency

3. **Predictive Analytics MCP Tests**

   - `tests/unit/predictiveAnalytics.test.js` - Tests predictive analytics MCP functions:
     - recommendLoanRestructuring
     - assessCropYieldRisk
     - analyzeMarketPriceImpact

4. **Manual MCP Tests**
   - `tests/manual-analytics-test.js` - Manual testing of predictive analytics functions
   - `test-risk-simple.js` - Simple test for risk functions

### MCP Infrastructure Tests (Keep)

These tests validate the MCP infrastructure and should be maintained:

1. **MCP Function Registry Tests**

   - `tests/unit/mcpFunctionRegistry.test.js` - Tests the MCP function registry
   - `tests/unit/mcpFunctions.test.js` - Tests individual MCP functions

2. **MCP Service Tests**

   - `tests/unit/mcpServiceWithLogging.test.js` - Tests the MCP service with logging

3. **OpenAI Integration Tests**
   - `tests/unit/openai-schemas.test.js` - Tests OpenAI schema validation
   - `tests/integration/openai-integration.test.js` - Tests OpenAI integration

### API-Driven Tests (Consider Removing)

These tests focus on API functionality rather than MCP and could be candidates for removal:

1. **Data Service Tests**

   - `tests/unit/data-service.test.js` - Tests data loading and retrieval
   - `tests/unit/data-loading.test.js` - Tests data loading functions

2. **API Endpoint Tests**

   - `tests/unit/api.test.js` - Tests basic API endpoints
   - `tests/integration/api.test.js` - Tests API integration
   - `tests/unit/loan-details.test.js` - Tests loan details endpoint
   - `tests/unit/loan-summary.test.js` - Tests loan summary endpoint
   - `tests/unit/edge-cases.test.js` - Tests edge cases for API endpoints

3. **Authentication Tests**

   - `tests/unit/auth/auth-controller.test.js` - Tests auth controller
   - `tests/unit/auth/auth-middleware.test.js` - Tests auth middleware
   - `tests/unit/auth/token-service.test.js` - Tests token service
   - `tests/unit/auth/user-service.test.js` - Tests user service
   - `tests/integration/auth-api.test.js` - Tests auth API
   - `tests/integration/auth-data-retrieval.test.js` - Tests data retrieval with auth

4. **Miscellaneous Tests**
   - `tests/unit/final-coverage.test.js` - Tests for code coverage
   - `tests/unit/remaining-coverage.test.js` - Tests for remaining code coverage
   - `tests/unit/endpoints.test.js` - Tests for endpoints
   - `tests/unit/utils.test.js` - Tests utility functions

### Duplicate/Redundant Tests (Remove)

These tests appear to be duplicates or redundant and should be removed:

1. **Duplicate Risk Tests**

   - `test-risk-functions.js` vs `test-risk-assessment-combined.js`
   - `test-risk-functions-fixed.js` (appears to be a fixed version of another test)
   - `BKUP/test-risk-functions.js` (backup version)

2. **Test Files in Root Directory**
   - `test-risk-assessment-combined.js` (duplicate of server version)
   - `test-risk-functions.js` (duplicate of server version)
   - `test-risk-simple.js` (duplicate of server version)

## Current Testing Issues

1. **Jest Configuration Issues**

   - Many Jest tests are failing due to configuration issues:
     - Problems with Chai exports
     - Issues with mocking fs.existsSync
     - Supertest issues with app.address

2. **Test Reliability Issues**

   - Integration tests are less reliable due to dependencies on external services
   - Some tests depend on specific data states

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - Some MCP functions lack comprehensive testing
   - Error handling paths need more coverage

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize MCP Function Tests**

   - Focus on maintaining and improving tests for MCP functions
   - Ensure all MCP functions have both unit and integration tests

2. **Consolidate Test Files**

   - Merge duplicate test files
   - Keep tests in the appropriate directories (server/tests/unit or server/tests/integration)

3. **Fix Jest Configuration**

   - Update Jest configuration to handle Chai exports
   - Fix mocking issues for fs.existsSync
   - Resolve Supertest issues

4. **Remove API-Only Tests**

   - Gradually phase out tests that only test API functionality and not MCP
   - Keep API tests that are essential for validating the end-to-end flow

5. **Improve Test Documentation**
   - Add better comments to test files
   - Create a test plan document that outlines the testing strategy

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Manual Tests**

   - Use manual test files for quick validation:
     - `node test-basic-loan-info.js`
     - `node test-risk-assessment-combined.js`
     - `node tests/manual-analytics-test.js`

2. **Automated Tests**

   - Fix Jest configuration issues
   - Run specific test categories:
     - `npm run test:unified:unit` for unit tests
     - `npm run test:unified:integration` for integration tests

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Implement a test coverage report
   - Identify and fill gaps in MCP function test coverage

## Conclusion

The testing strategy should focus on MCP functions and their integration with OpenAI, as these are the core components of the LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC project. API-driven tests that don't directly validate MCP functionality should be considered for removal to streamline the testing process and improve maintainability.

By prioritizing MCP-driven tests and fixing the current testing issues, we can ensure that the core functionality of the project is well-tested while reducing the maintenance burden of unnecessary tests.
