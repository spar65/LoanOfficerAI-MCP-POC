# LoanOfficerAI MCP Client Test Results

This document contains the results of running the client-side tests for the LoanOfficerAI MCP POC project.

## Test Setup

The client tests are using React Testing Library with Jest for unit testing React components. Running `npm test` launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## Test Environment

```
Node version: v18.x (LTS)
React version: 19.1.0
Testing libraries:
- @testing-library/jest-dom: ^6.6.3
- @testing-library/react: ^16.3.0
- @testing-library/user-event: ^14.6.1
```

## Automated Test Results

```
Test Suites: 6 failed, 2 passed, 8 total
Tests:       7 failed, 11 passed, 18 total
```

### Passing Tests

1. **Auth Tests**:

   - Authentication data is properly stored and retrieved
   - Detects invalid auth data
   - Properly handles token validation
   - Logout functionality works correctly

2. **Simple Tests**:
   - Basic functionality tests pass

### Failing Tests

1. **Chatbot Component Tests**:

   - Failing due to React 19 compatibility issues with MUI components
   - Error: `Cannot destructure property 'current' of 'React.useRef(...)' as it is undefined`

2. **MCP Client Utility Tests**:

   - Network-related failures when accessing API endpoints
   - Missing mocks for axios and API responses

3. **App and Dashboard Tests**:

   - Missing dependencies for MUI components like `@mui/x-charts/PieChart`

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - Module parsing issues with import/export syntax
   - Axios compatibility issues with Jest

## Manual Testing Results

Since the automated tests have multiple issues, we performed manual tests on the key client functionality:

### Chatbot Component

**Functionality**: ✅ Working

- Successful login (using john.doe/password123)
- Dashboard loads with loan data
- Chatbot panel slides in from right
- System shows "operational" status
- UI includes organized example query chips by category

**Example Queries Tested**:

- "Show me all active loans" - ✅ Works
- "Give me the portfolio summary" - ✅ Works
- "What is the status of loan L001?" - ✅ Works

### MCP Integration

**Functionality**: ⚠️ Partially Working

- Basic queries using the HTTP client implementation work correctly
- Server correctly processes authentication headers
- Response formatting is consistent

## Known Issues

1. **Testing Framework Issues**:

   - React 19.1.0 is not fully compatible with the current testing setup
   - Missing mocks for MUI components and API requests
   - ESM/CJS module conflicts with axios imports

2. **Component Testing Issues**:

   - Failed to render Chatbot component in tests
   - Material UI component errors during testing
   - Missing mocked context providers

3. **Client API Integration**:
   - Network errors in tests attempting real API calls
   - Missing proper mocks for API responses

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Testing Environment**:

   - Downgrade React to a more stable version or update testing configuration
   - Add proper mocks for Material UI components
   - Configure Jest to handle ESM imports properly

2. **Improve Test Coverage**:

   - Add proper mocks for API calls
   - Create isolated component tests that don't depend on network
   - Add tests for MCP client integration

3. **Authentication Testing**:

   - Expand tests for the full authentication flow
   - Add tests for token refresh and expiration

4. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement Cypress or similar for critical user journeys
