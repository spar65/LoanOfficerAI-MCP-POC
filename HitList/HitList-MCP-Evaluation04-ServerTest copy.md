# LoanOfficerAI MCP Server Test Results

This document contains the results of running the server-side tests for the LoanOfficerAI MCP POC project.

## Test Results

```
> mcp-server@1.0.0 test
> jest --config jest.config.js --verbose

Test Suites: 15 failed, 4 skipped, 5 passed, 20 of 24 total
Tests:       45 skipped, 22 passed, 67 total

PASSING TESTS:
- tests/unit/auth-utils.test.js - Password Validation and Token Utilities tests
- tests/unit/mock-data.test.js - Tests for proper data structure in mock data
- tests/unit/openai-schemas.test.js - OpenAI Integration Schema Tests
- tests/unit/utils.test.js - Utility Functions tests for formatting and calculations
- tests/unit/simple.test.js - (passed but not listed in logs)

FAILING TESTS:
Most failures are due to missing dependencies, primarily 'supertest' module.
Main error: "Cannot find module 'supertest' from [test file]"

PASSING TEST DETAILS:

Auth Utilities:
- Password Validation:
  ✓ strong password should be valid
  ✓ weak passwords should be invalid
- Token Utilities:
  ✓ can extract token from authorization header
  ✓ can validate token expiration
- Role-Based Access Control:
  ✓ can check if user has required role
  ✓ can check if admin user can access multi-tenant data

Mock Data Tests:
  ✓ loans have the expected structure
  ✓ borrowers have the expected structure
  ✓ can calculate total loan amount
  ✓ can join loan and borrower data

OpenAI Integration Schema Tests:
  ✓ MCP function schemas are valid for OpenAI
  ✓ OpenAI API key validation logic works correctly
  ✓ Response handlers correctly process different OpenAI formats

Utility Functions:
  ✓ formatCurrency formats amount correctly
  ✓ calculateMonthlyPayment calculates correctly
  ✓ calculateTotalInterest calculates correctly
  ✓ formatDate formats date correctly
  ✓ getFullName combines names correctly

COVERAGE SUMMARY:
Overall test coverage is very low:
- Statements: 1.63%
- Branches: 0.23%
- Functions: 0%
- Lines: 1.78%

The highest coverage is in the auth module:
- authController.js: 11.53%
- authMiddleware.js: 14.28%
- tokenService.js: 37.03%
- userService.js: 26.66%
- config.js: 100%
```

## Analysis

The server test results show a mixed picture:

1. **Core Utilities Pass**: Basic utility functions for data formatting, authentication, and validation are working correctly.

2. **OpenAI Integration Tests Pass**: The schema validation for MCP functions is working correctly.

3. **Test Framework Issues**: Many tests are failing due to missing dependencies like `supertest`.

4. **Low Coverage**: The overall test coverage is extremely low at under 2% of the codebase.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the dependency issues by installing required modules.
2. Focus on increasing test coverage, particularly for the core API endpoints.
3. Create tests specifically for the MCP functionality.
4. Add tests for the chatbot integration with the API.
