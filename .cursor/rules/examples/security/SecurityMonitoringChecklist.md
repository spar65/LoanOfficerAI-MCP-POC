## Implementation Examples

### SIEM Rule Example (Splunk)

```
# Suspicious Account Behavior Detection Rule

# Search for multiple failed authentication attempts followed by a successful login
index=authentication (action=failure OR action=success) user=*
| bucket span=10m _time
| stats count(eval(action="failure")) as failure_count, count(eval(action="success")) as success_count, values(src_ip) as src_ips, values(action) as actions by _time, user
| where failure_count > 5 AND success_count > 0
| eval distinct_ips=mvcount(src_ips)
| where distinct_ips > 1
| rename _time as timespan
| table timespan, user, failure_count, success_count, distinct_ips, src_ips, actions
| sort -failure_count
```

### Azure Sentinel KQL Query Example

```
// Detect when a user authenticates from multiple countries in a short time period
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| extend country = tostring(LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| where isnotempty(country)
| summarize
    countries = make_set(country),
    countriesCount = dcount(country),
    authenticationAttempts = count(),
    latestAttempt = max(TimeGenerated),
    ipAddresses = make_set(IPAddress)
    by UserPrincipalName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where countriesCount > 1
| project
    TimeGenerated,
    UserPrincipalName,
    countriesCount,
    countries,
    authenticationAttempts,
    latestAttempt,
    ipAddresses
| order by countriesCount desc, authenticationAttempts desc
```

- Maintain evidence of data protection measures
- Create specific detection rules for data protection violations
- Establish accelerated response workflows for personal data incidents
