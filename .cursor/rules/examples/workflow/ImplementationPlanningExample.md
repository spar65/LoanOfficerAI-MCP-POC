# Implementation Planning Example: User Notification System

This example demonstrates how to apply the Implementation Planning guidelines to create a detailed plan for a new feature - a user notification system that sends alerts through multiple channels.

## 1. Business Requirements Analysis

### Parsed Requirements

```
Original requirement: "Implement a notification system that allows users to receive alerts via email, in-app notifications, and SMS based on their preferences."

Parsed requirements:
- Create user notification preferences UI to select channels (email, in-app, SMS)
- Implement notification storage system for pending/sent notifications
- Build notification delivery system for each channel
- Develop notification creation API for other system components
- Implement notification history and management for users
```

### Requirement Categorization

**User Interface Changes**

- Notification preferences page in user settings
- In-app notification center with read/unread status
- Notification badge on header
- Notification detail view

**Data Model Changes**

- Notification entity (id, type, content, status, timestamps)
- NotificationDelivery entity (notification_id, channel, status, timestamps)
- UserNotificationPreferences entity (user_id, channel_enabled flags, quiet_hours)

**Business Logic**

- Notification distribution logic based on user preferences
- Rate limiting for notifications
- Grouping of similar notifications
- Priority-based delivery scheduling

**API Changes**

- Create notification endpoints
- Notification preferences management
- Notification status updates (read/unread)
- Notification history retrieval

**Infrastructure Updates**

- Email delivery service integration
- SMS gateway integration
- Push notification service for mobile apps

### Requirement Validation

**User Experience**

- Users must be able to easily enable/disable each notification channel
- Notification history should be easily accessible
- Critical notifications should be highlighted

**Error Handling**

- Handle delivery failures with retry mechanism
- Fallback to alternative channels if primary channel fails
- Track notification delivery status

**Security**

- Ensure sensitive notification content is not leaked
- Validate notification permissions before delivery
- Protect against notification spam

**Performance**

- Notifications should be delivered within 30 seconds for high priority
- System should handle 100,000 notifications per hour

**Backwards Compatibility**

- Existing email notifications should be migrated to new system

## 2. Technical Design Breakdown

### Architecture Alignment

The notification system should integrate with our existing architecture:

- Use the existing user service for preferences storage
- Leverage the event bus for notification triggers
- Implement as a microservice with clear interfaces
- Follow existing patterns for database access and API design

### Component Mapping

**Frontend Components**

```
- NotificationPreferencesForm (extends existing SettingsForm)
  - ChannelToggleGroup component
  - QuietHoursSelector component
- NotificationCenter component
  - NotificationList component
  - NotificationItem component
  - NotificationFilters component
- NotificationBadge component (header integration)
```

**Backend Services**

```
- NotificationService
  - createNotification(userId, type, content, priority)
  - markAsRead(notificationId)
  - getNotifications(userId, filters)
- NotificationDeliveryService
  - scheduleDelivery(notification, channels)
  - trackDeliveryStatus(deliveryId)
- ChannelDeliveryServices
  - EmailDeliveryService
  - SMSDeliveryService
  - InAppDeliveryService
- NotificationPreferencesService
  - getUserPreferences(userId)
  - updateUserPreferences(userId, preferences)
```

**Database Changes**

```

**Internal Dependencies**

- User Service API for user data and preferences
- Event Bus for notification triggers
- Authentication Service for securing endpoints

**Potential Version Conflicts**

- Need to ensure Firebase SDK is compatible with our mobile app versions

**Shared Component Updates**

- Header component needs updates to include notification badge
- Settings page needs to include notification preferences section

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements**

- Notification delivery service must scale horizontally
- Database should be optimized for high write throughput
- Notification queries must be optimized with proper indexes

**Security Requirements**

- PII in notifications must be encrypted at rest
- All notification APIs must require authentication
- SMS delivery must comply with telecom regulations

**Compatibility Needs**

   - Set up basic API endpoints

2. **Delivery Channel Phase**

   - Implement EmailDeliveryService
   - Implement InAppDeliveryService
   - Implement SMSDeliveryService
   - Create channel delivery scheduler

3. **Preference Management Phase**

   - Create user preference data models
   - Implement NotificationPreferencesService
   - Build preference management API

4. **Frontend Implementation Phase**

   - Build NotificationCenter component
   - Implement NotificationBadge
   - Create NotificationPreferencesForm
   - Integrate with header component

5. **Testing & Integration Phase**

   - End-to-end testing of notification flow
   - Performance testing
   - Security review
   - UI/UX review

6. **Migration Phase**

   - Deprecate legacy notification code

### Dependency Resolution Path

1. Create shared data models and interfaces first
2. Implement core notification services
3. Integrate external delivery services
4. Build frontend components
5. Connect frontend to backend APIs

### Parallel Work Identification

The following components can be developed in parallel:

- Frontend notification UI can be developed alongside backend services
- Different delivery channels can be implemented by separate developers
- User preference UI and API can be built alongside notification delivery system

## 4. Implementation Details

### Code Structure Planning

**NotificationService Interface**

```typescript
interface NotificationContent {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  link?: string;
  data?: Record<string, any>;
}

enum NotificationPriority {
  LOW = 0,
  MEDIUM = 1,
  HIGH = 2,
  CRITICAL = 3,
}

enum NotificationChannel {
  EMAIL = "email",
  SMS = "sms",
  IN_APP = "in_app",
  PUSH = "push",
}

interface CreateNotificationParams {
  userId: string;
  type: string;
  content: NotificationContent;
  priority: NotificationPriority;
  channels?: NotificationChannel[];
}

interface NotificationService {
  createNotification(params: CreateNotificationParams): Promise<Notification>;
  markAsRead(notificationId: string): Promise<void>;
  getNotifications(
    userId: string,
    filters?: NotificationFilters
  ): Promise<Notification[]>;
}
```

**NotificationDeliveryService Interface**

```typescript
interface DeliveryResult {
  success: boolean;
  channel: NotificationChannel;
  timestamp: Date;
  error?: string;
}

interface NotificationDeliveryService {
  scheduleDelivery(
    notification: Notification,
    channels: NotificationChannel[]
  ): Promise<void>;
  getDeliveryStatus(
    notificationId: string
  ): Promise<Record<NotificationChannel, DeliveryResult>>;
  retryFailedDeliveries(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Edge Case Handling

**Identified Edge Cases**

- User has disabled all notification channels
- Delivery to a channel fails (e.g., invalid email, SMS fails)
- User changes preferences while notifications are pending
- Notification content contains special characters or long text
- Rate limits reached for external services
- High notification volume during peak times

**Handling Strategies**

- For users with all channels disabled, store notifications as in-app only
- Implement retry mechanism with backoff for failed deliveries
- Cache delivery preferences at time of notification creation
- Sanitize and truncate notification content appropriately for each channel
- Implement queuing system with priority for external service rate limits
- Design system to scale horizontally during high volume periods

### Error Management Strategy

**Expected Exceptions**

- `InvalidNotificationContent`: When notification content doesn't meet requirements
- `DeliveryFailure`: When a specific channel delivery fails
- `UserNotFoundError`: When target user doesn't exist
- `ChannelNotAvailableError`: When a requested channel is not available/configured

**Error Logging**

- Log all delivery attempts with status
- Track retry counts and final delivery status
- Alert on high failure rates for specific channels

**Fallback Behaviors**

- If SMS fails, attempt to deliver via email if enabled
- If all external channels fail, ensure in-app notification is created
- For critical notifications, alert system administrators on delivery failures

### Performance Optimization Approach

**Potential Bottlenecks**

- Database writes during high notification volume
- External service API rate limits
- Notification history queries for active users

**Optimization Strategies**

- Implement notification queuing with Redis
- Use database sharding for notification storage
- Create read replicas for notification history queries
- Implement caching for user preferences and notification counts
- Use batch processing for delivery status updates

## 5. Testing Strategy
