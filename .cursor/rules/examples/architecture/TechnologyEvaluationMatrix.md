# Technology Evaluation Matrix

## Overview

This document provides a standardized framework for evaluating technology components and making informed selection decisions. The Technology Evaluation Matrix helps teams assess technologies against consistent criteria, document the decision-making process, and maintain a record of technology evaluations.

## Evaluation Process

The technology evaluation process consists of the following steps:

1. **Identify Requirements**: Define the specific requirements and use cases the technology needs to address
2. **Define Evaluation Criteria**: Select and weight the evaluation criteria based on project priorities
3. **Identify Candidates**: Research and identify candidate technologies for evaluation
4. **Evaluate Each Candidate**: Score each technology against the criteria
5. **Calculate Overall Scores**: Determine the final weighted scores
6. **Document Decision**: Record the evaluation process, scores, and final decision

## Evaluation Criteria

The following criteria should be used when evaluating technology components:

#### Detailed Assessment

##### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL scores highly for its mature feature set, strong ACID compliance, and extensive community support. The team has significant experience with PostgreSQL, reducing implementation risk. While it offers less out-of-the-box scalability than cloud-native solutions, we can address this with connection pooling and read replicas. The robust SQL support aligns well with our reporting requirements.

Strengths:

- Mature, stable technology with strong community
- Excellent data integrity and ACID compliance
- Rich feature set including JSON support
- Strong team expertise
- No licensing costs

Weaknesses:

- Requires more configuration for high availability
- Horizontal scaling is more complex than cloud-native solutions
- May require more operational overhead

##### MongoDB

MongoDB offers excellent horizontal scaling and flexible schema design, which could benefit our microservices architecture. However, it has limitations in transaction support and joins that impact our reporting requirements. The team would need significant training to effectively use and maintain MongoDB in production.

Strengths:

- Excellent horizontal scaling
- Flexible schema design
- Good performance for document-based access patterns
- Active development community

Weaknesses:

- Weaker transaction support
- Limited join capabilities for complex reporting
- Team lacks experience with document databases
- Less mature ecosystem for enterprise tooling

##### Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora provides excellent performance, scalability, and managed services benefits while maintaining PostgreSQL compatibility. This reduces operational overhead and provides strong disaster recovery options. The main concerns are higher costs and potential vendor lock-in.

Strengths:

- Excellent performance and scalability
- Compatible with PostgreSQL drivers and tools
- Managed service reduces operational overhead
- Automated backups and high availability
- Seamless integration with AWS services

Weaknesses:

- Higher cost compared to self-managed solutions
- Vendor lock-in with AWS
- Less control over configuration and tuning
- Limited to AWS regions

#### Recommendation

Based on the evaluation, we recommend PostgreSQL for our microservices database. While Amazon Aurora scored similarly, PostgreSQL provides better cost efficiency, reduces vendor lock-in risk, and leverages our team's existing expertise. To address the scalability concerns, we will implement connection pooling, read replicas, and investigate PostgreSQL sharding solutions.

For future consideration, we should re-evaluate Amazon Aurora if operational overhead becomes a significant concern or if our AWS footprint grows substantially.

#### Decision

The team has approved the recommendation to proceed with PostgreSQL. Implementation will begin with the following conditions:

1. Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
2. Establish automated backup and recovery procedures
3. Create a database scaling plan to address future growth
4. Revisit the decision in 12 months or if requirements change significantly

## Conclusion

The Technology Evaluation Matrix provides a structured approach to assess technology options against consistent criteria. By using this framework, teams can make more informed decisions, document their reasoning, and maintain a historical record of technology choices, which is valuable for future reviews and audits.

When completing the matrix, consider the following best practices:

- Involve a diverse team with different perspectives and expertise
- Use concrete examples and benchmarks whenever possible
- Capture qualitative insights alongside quantitative scores
- Document assumptions and constraints that influenced the decision
- Include a post-decision review plan to validate the selection
