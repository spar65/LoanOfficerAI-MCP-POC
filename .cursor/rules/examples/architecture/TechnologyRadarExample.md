# Enterprise Technology Radar

## Introduction

The Enterprise Technology Radar is a visual representation of our technology landscape that helps guide technology decisions and investment. It provides a concise view of technologies we're currently using, evaluating, or phasing out, helping teams make informed technology choices aligned with enterprise strategy.

This document outlines how to create, maintain, and use a Technology Radar within the enterprise context.

## Radar Structure

The Technology Radar is organized into four quadrants and four rings:

### Quadrants

1. **Languages & Frameworks**: Programming languages, frameworks, and language extensions
2. **Tools**: Software development tools, testing tools, and operational utilities
3. **Platforms**: Software that provides a foundation for building and running applications
4. **Techniques**: Approaches, methodologies, patterns, and practices

### Rings

1. **Adopt**: Technologies we use widely and recommend for enterprise use
2. **Trial**: Technologies we're using in limited production contexts to gain experience
3. **Assess**: Technologies we're exploring to understand their potential impact
4. **Hold**: Technologies we recommend against using for new initiatives

## Technology Assessment Process

### Assessment Criteria

Technologies are evaluated against the following criteria:

| Criteria                 | Description                                                          | Weight |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Strategic Alignment**  | How well the technology aligns with enterprise architecture strategy | High   |
| **Maturity & Stability** | The technology's stability, reliability, and industry adoption       | High   |
| **Capability Value**     | The capabilities gained relative to existing technologies            | Medium |
| **Operational Impact**   | The effect on operational complexity and supportability              | Medium |
| **Security Profile**     | Security characteristics and vulnerability history                   | High   |
| **Cost of Ownership**    | Total cost including licensing, infrastructure, and maintenance      | Medium |
| **Skills Availability**  | Availability of skills in the market and within the organization     | Medium |
| **Ecosystem Health**     | Size and activity of the community, quality of documentation         | Low    |

### Assessment Workflow

1. **Technology Nomination**: Teams propose technologies for assessment
2. **Initial Assessment**: Architecture team conducts preliminary evaluation
3. **Proof of Concept**: For promising technologies, validate through limited testing
4. **Ring Placement Decision**: Architecture Review Board determines radar placement
5. **Regular Review**: All technologies are re-evaluated each quarter

   - React: Used by 60% of teams
   - Angular: Used by 25% of teams
   - Vue: Used by 10% of teams
   - Other: 5% of teams

2. **Evaluation Criteria**:

   - Developer productivity
   - Performance characteristics
   - Ecosystem maturity
   - Learning curve
   - Long-term viability
   - Enterprise support needs

3. **Radar Decision**:

   - React 18+: Placed in **Adopt** ring
   - Next.js: Placed in **Trial** ring
   - Angular: Moved to **Hold** for new projects
   - Vue: Placed in **Hold** for enterprise applications
   - Svelte: Placed in **Assess** ring for evaluation

4. **Outcome**:
   - Standardization on React for all new web applications
   - Center of Excellence established for React development
   - Migration plan created for Angular applications
   - Next.js used for five new projects to evaluate benefits

### Results

Six months after this decision:

- Developer productivity increased due to shared components
- Onboarding time for new developers decreased by 30%
- Codebase consistency improved significantly
- Shared component library reduced duplication
- Resource sharing between teams increased

## Conclusion

The Technology Radar provides a structured approach to technology governance that balances innovation with enterprise needs. By clearly communicating technology choices and their rationale, organizations can make more informed decisions, reduce risk, and ensure strategic alignment.

Key benefits include:

- **Transparency** in technology decision-making
- **Consistency** across teams and projects
- **Strategic alignment** with enterprise architecture
- **Controlled innovation** that balances risk and value
- **Clear guidance** for teams making technology choices

When implemented effectively, the Technology Radar becomes a crucial tool for technology governance and a key enabler of digital transformation.
