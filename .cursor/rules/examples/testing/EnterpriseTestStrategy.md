# Enterprise Test Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for enterprise applications, integrating various testing approaches across the development lifecycle.

## Testing Pyramid

Our enterprise testing strategy follows the Testing Pyramid approach, emphasizing a strong foundation of unit tests, complemented by integration tests and end-to-end tests:

```

-----------------
```

### Distribution Targets

- **Unit Tests**: 70% of test efforts
- **Integration Tests**: 20% of test efforts
- **End-to-End Tests**: 10% of test efforts

## Testing Types and Responsibilities

Each testing type serves a specific purpose in our strategy:

### Unit Testing

**Purpose**: Verify individual components, functions, or classes in isolation.

**Responsibility**: Developers are responsible for writing unit tests.

**Key Aspects**:

- Should follow the [Test-First Mandate](mdc:departments/engineering/testing/300-test-first-mandate.mdc)
- Must test both happy paths and edge cases
- Should run quickly (milliseconds per test)
- Must not depend on external systems
- Should use mocks/stubs for dependencies
- Must be executed in the [Development Environment](mdc:departments/engineering/testing/116-testing-environments.mdc)

**Tools**:

- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- JUnit for Java projects
- pytest for Python projects
- NUnit for .NET projects

### Integration Testing

**Purpose**: Verify interactions between components or systems, including database and external services.

**Responsibility**: Developers and QA engineers collaborate on integration tests.

**Key Aspects**:

- Should verify proper communication between components
- Must test interface contracts
- Should test database interactions
- Should test error handling between components
- Must be executed in the [Integration Environment](mdc:departments/engineering/testing/116-testing-environments.mdc)

**Tools**:

- Supertest for API testing in Node.js

### End-to-End Testing

**Purpose**: Verify the entire application workflow from user perspective.

**Responsibility**: QA engineers lead E2E test development, with developer input.

**Key Aspects**:

- Should focus on critical user journeys
- Must test complete business processes
- Should verify key user interactions
- Must be executed in the [Staging Environment](mdc:departments/engineering/testing/116-testing-environments.mdc)
- Should test across multiple browsers/devices

**Tools**:

- Cypress for web applications
- Playwright for cross-browser testing
- Appium for mobile applications
- Selenium for legacy applications

### Performance Testing

**Purpose**: Verify system behavior under various load conditions.

**Responsibility**: Performance engineering team with input from developers.

**Key Aspects**:

- Must establish baseline performance metrics
- Should test load capacity, response times, and stability
- Must identify bottlenecks and performance degradations
- Should be executed in the [Staging Environment](mdc:departments/engineering/testing/116-testing-environments.mdc)

**Tools**:

- k6 for script-based load testing
- JMeter for complex performance testing
- Gatling for high-scale performance testing
- New Relic/Datadog for monitoring

### Security Testing

**Purpose**: Identify security vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

**Responsibility**: Security team with collaboration from developers.

**Key Aspects**:

- Must include SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Must include DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Should include penetration testing for critical systems
- Must verify compliance with security policies
- Should be executed across all environments

**Tools**:

- SonarQube for SAST
- OWASP ZAP for DAST
- Snyk for dependency scanning
- Burp Suite for penetration testing

## Test Automation Strategy

### Automation Criteria

Use these criteria to determine what to automate:

1. **High-value business flows**: Critical paths that affect revenue or core functionality
2. **Regression-prone areas**: Features that frequently break with changes
3. **Repetitive tests**: Tests that need to run frequently or consistently
4. **Stable features**: Stable areas of the application less likely to change
5. **Performance-critical paths**: Functions that must meet performance requirements

### Automation Framework Principles

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to update when application changes
2. **Readability**: Tests should be easily understood by all team members
3. **Reliability**: Tests should produce consistent results
4. **Speed**: Test suites should execute quickly
5. **Isolation**: Tests should not interfere with each other

### CI/CD Integration

All automated tests should be integrated into CI/CD pipelines with the following guidelines:

- **Unit Tests**: Run on every commit
- **Integration Tests**: Run on feature branch completion and merges to main
- **Core E2E Tests**: Run on merges to main
- **Full E2E Suite**: Run nightly and before releases
- **Performance Tests**: Run weekly and before releases
- **Security Tests**: Run weekly and before releases

## Test Data Management

Test data should be managed according to the [Test Data Management Guide](mdc:examples/testing/TestDataManagementGuide.md) with these key principles:

1. **Data Isolation**: Each test must have isolated data
2. **Data Consistency**: Test data must be consistent across test runs
3. **Data Security**: No production PII in test environments
4. **Data Resetting**: Tests must reset data to original state
5. **Data Flexibility**: Data must support various test scenarios

### Environment-Specific Test Data Guidelines

| Environment | Data Source           | Refresh Frequency | PII Handling    |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Development | Synthetic data        | On-demand         | No real PII     |
| Integration | Synthetic + Snapshots | Daily             | No real PII     |
| Staging     | Anonymized production | Weekly            | Masked PII      |
| Production  | Real data             | N/A               | Full protection |

## Test Reporting and Metrics

### Key Metrics

Track these metrics to evaluate testing effectiveness:

1. **Test Coverage**: Line, branch, function coverage percentages
2. **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of passing tests
3. **Test Execution Time**: Duration of test suite execution
4. **Defect Detection Rate**: Number of defects found by tests vs. escaped to production
5. **Test Stability**: Percentage of test flakiness

### Reporting Requirements

1. Test results must be published to a central dashboard
2. Reports must include trends over time
3. Critical failures must trigger immediate notifications
4. Coverage reports must be published for all projects
5. Regular testing quality audits must be performed

## Defect Management Process

### Defect Lifecycle

```
┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ Identified │────▶│  Analyzed  │────▶│  Assigned  │
└──────┬─────┘     └──────┬─────┘     └──────┬─────┘
       │                  │                  │
       │                  │                  │
┌──────▼─────┐     ┌──────▼─────┐     ┌──────▼─────┐
│  Verified  │◀────│  Resolved  │◀────│ In Progress │

       │
       │
┌──────▼─────┐
│   Closed   │
└────────────┘
```

### Defect Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition                 | Response Time | Resolution Time |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Critical | System unusable, data loss | Immediate     | < 24 hours      |
| High     | Major feature broken       | < 4 hours     | < 3 days        |
| Medium   | Feature partially broken   | < 8 hours     | < 7 days        |
| Low      | Minor issues, cosmetic     | < 24 hours    | < 14 days       |

1. Quarterly test strategy reviews
2. Regular test automation health checks
3. Test knowledge sharing sessions
4. Test tool evaluations and upgrades
5. Process improvement workshops

## Testing Community of Practice

Establish a Testing Community of Practice (CoP) with these activities:

1. Regular meetings to share best practices
2. Internal test training and workshops
3. External conference participation
4. Testing blog or knowledge base
5. Cross-team test mentorship
