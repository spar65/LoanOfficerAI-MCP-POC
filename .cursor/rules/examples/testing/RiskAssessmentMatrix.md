# Risk Assessment Matrix for High-Risk Features

## Overview

This document provides a standardized approach for assessing the risk level of application features to determine appropriate testing strategies. The risk assessment matrix helps development teams classify features based on their potential impact and determine the required level of testing rigor.

## Risk Assessment Process

### Step 1: Feature Classification

Begin by categorizing the feature according to its capabilities:

| Feature Category               | Description                           | Example                                     | Base Risk Level |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Critical Business Function** | Core revenue-generating features      | Payment processing, subscription management | High            |
| **Data Management**            | Features handling sensitive data      | User profiles, financial records            | High            |
| **Authentication & Security**  | Security-related functionality        | Login systems, access control               | High            |
| **Integration Points**         | External service connections          | Third-party APIs, payment gateways          | Medium-High     |
| **High-Volume Operations**     | Features with significant traffic     | Search functionality, content delivery      | Medium-High     |
| **User Management**            | Features managing user actions        | User registration, profile editing          | Medium          |
| **Content Management**         | Features managing application content | CMS functionality, media handling           | Medium          |

### Step 2: Risk Factor Evaluation

Evaluate the feature against specific risk factors:

#### Business Impact Factors

| Factor                    | Low (1)                      | Medium (3)                   | High (5)                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Revenue Impact**        | No direct revenue connection | Indirect revenue influence   | Direct revenue generation      |
| **User Visibility**       | Internal/admin use only      | Limited user exposure        | High user visibility           |
| **Reputational Risk**     | Minimal brand impact         | Moderate brand impact        | Significant brand impact       |
| **Competitive Advantage** | Not differentiating          | Somewhat differentiating     | Key differentiator             |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | No regulatory requirements   | Some regulatory implications | Strict regulatory requirements |

#### Technical Risk Factors

| Factor                       | Low (1)                        | Medium (3)             | High (5)                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Architectural Complexity** | Simple, isolated               | Moderate complexity    | Highly complex, distributed    |
| **Data Sensitivity**         | Public/non-sensitive data      | Internal business data | PII, financial, or health data |
| **Transaction Volume**       | Low volume                     | Moderate volume        | High volume/throughput         |
| **System Dependencies**      | Few/simple dependencies        | Multiple dependencies  | Complex dependency chain       |
| **Technology Maturity**      | Proven, established technology | Moderately established | New or emerging technology     |

#### Security Risk Factors

| Factor                          | Low (1)                     | Medium (3)              | High (5)                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Authentication Requirements** | No authentication           | Standard authentication | Enhanced security (MFA, etc.) |
| **Authorization Complexity**    | Public/single role          | Few roles/permissions   | Complex role-based access     |
| **Data Exposure Risk**          | No sensitive data exposed   | Limited sensitive data  | Significant sensitive data    |
| **Attack Surface**              | Minimal external exposure   | Moderate exposure       | Extensive attack surface      |
| **Vulnerability Impact**        | Limited impact if exploited | Moderate impact         | Severe impact if exploited    |

### Step 3: Calculate Risk Score

Calculate the overall risk score by:

1. Summing the scores for each factor category
2. Determining the category risk level
3. Applying any automatic elevators
4. Calculating the final risk classification

```javascript
// Example risk calculation logic
function calculateRiskLevel(factors) {
  // Calculate category scores
  const businessImpactScore = factors.businessFactors.reduce(
    (sum, factor) => sum + factor.score,
    0
  );
  const technicalRiskScore = factors.technicalFactors.reduce(
    (sum, factor) => sum + factor.score,
    0
  );
  const securityRiskScore = factors.securityFactors.reduce(
    (sum, factor) => sum + factor.score,
    0
  );

  // Calculate category risk levels
  const businessRiskLevel = calculateCategoryLevel(businessImpactScore, 25);
  const technicalRiskLevel = calculateCategoryLevel(technicalRiskScore, 25);
  const securityRiskLevel = calculateCategoryLevel(securityRiskScore, 25);

  // Apply automatic elevators
  if (
    factors.dataClassification === "PII" ||
    factors.dataClassification === "PCI" ||
    factors.dataClassification === "PHI"
  ) {
    securityRiskLevel = "High";
  }

  // Determine overall risk level (highest of the three)
  return [businessRiskLevel, technicalRiskLevel, securityRiskLevel].sort(
    (a, b) => riskLevelValue(b) - riskLevelValue(a)
  )[0];
}

function calculateCategoryLevel(score, maxScore) {
  const percentage = (score / maxScore) * 100;
  if (percentage >= 70) return "High";
  if (percentage >= 40) return "Medium";
  return "Low";
}

function riskLevelValue(level) {
  switch (level) {
    case "High":
      return 3;
    case "Medium":
      return 2;
    case "Low":
      return 1;
    default:
      return 0;
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Determine Risk Classification

Based on the overall risk score, classify the feature into one of four risk levels:

| Risk Level   | Score Range                        | Testing Requirements                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | 70-100% or any automatic elevators | Comprehensive testing across all dimensions              |
| **High**     | 50-69%                             | Enhanced testing focusing on high-risk areas             |
| **Medium**   | 30-49%                             | Standard testing with attention to specific risk factors |
| **Low**      | 0-29%                              | Standard testing procedures                              |
