## 1. Incident Detection & Declaration

### Detection Methods

- **Automated Alerts**: Monitoring system triggers based on predefined thresholds
- **User Reports**: Customer support tickets or direct user feedback
- **Internal Discovery**: Team member notices unusual behavior
- **Dependency Notification**: Notification from a third-party service provider

### Incident Declaration Criteria

An incident should be declared when any of the following occur:

- Production service is unavailable or severely degraded
- Critical functionality is impaired
- Data integrity is compromised
- Security breach is suspected
- Significant performance degradation affects user experience

### Declaration Process

1. Assess the situation against declaration criteria
2. Determine preliminary severity (P1-P4)
3. Open an incident ticket in the incident management system
4. Activate the appropriate incident response team
5. Notify stakeholders according to severity

## 2. Incident Response Team Roles

## 5. Investigation & Mitigation

### Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Review monitoring dashboards and alerts
- [ ] Analyze recent deployments or changes
- [ ] Check system logs for errors
- [ ] Verify infrastructure status
- [ ] Test affected functionality
- [ ] Check dependent service status
- [ ] Review recent relevant incidents for patterns

### Common Mitigation Strategies

1. **Rollback to Previous Version**

   - Revert to the last known good state
   - `kubectl rollout undo deployment/[service-name]`

2. **Traffic Rerouting**

   - Redirect traffic to healthy instances
   - Update load balancer configuration

3. **Scaling Resources**

   - Increase capacity to handle load
   - `kubectl scale deployment/[service-name] --replicas=[count]`

4. **Database Failover**

   - Switch to replica if primary is problematic
   - Verify data consistency after failover

5. **Feature Flag Toggles**

   - Disable problematic features
   - `curl -X POST https://api.example.com/features/[feature-name]/disable`

6. **Cache Clearing**

   - Reset problematic cache data
   - `redis-cli FLUSHDB` (use with caution)

7. **Restart Services**
   - Restart affected components
   - `kubectl rollout restart deployment/[service-name]`

### Validation Steps

- Verify functionality through automated tests
- Perform manual testing of affected features
- Check monitoring dashboards for normalization
- Confirm with affected users if possible

## 6. Incident Resolution

### Resolution Criteria

An incident can be resolved when:

1. Service functionality is restored to normal
2. Root cause is understood (or has a plan for deeper investigation)
3. Mitigations are stable and verified
4. Users are no longer impacted
5. Communication has been provided to all stakeholders

### Resolution Process

1. Verify that all resolution criteria are met
2. Announce resolution to all stakeholders
3. Update incident ticket with final status
4. Schedule post-incident review
5. Hand off any follow-up items to appropriate teams

## 7. Post-Incident Analysis

### Post-Mortem Meeting Agenda

1. **Incident Overview** (5 minutes)

   - Brief summary of the incident
   - Timeline of key events

2. **Impact Assessment** (5 minutes)

   - User impact
   - Business impact

   - Detection improvements
   - Response improvements
   - Process improvements

5. **Assign Action Items** (10 minutes)
   - Define owners

### Root Cause Analysis Techniques

1. **5 Whys Analysis**

   - Start with the problem statement
   - Ask "why" repeatedly to drill down to root causes
   - Typically 5 levels deep, but can vary

2. **Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram**

   - Categorize potential causes (People, Process, Technology, Environment)
   - Branch out to specific factors within each category
   - Identify relationships between factors

3. **Timeline Analysis**
   - Create a detailed timeline of events
   - Identify decision points and information gaps
   - Look for cascade effects and triggers
