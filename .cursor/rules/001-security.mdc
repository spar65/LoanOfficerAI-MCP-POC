# Core Security Principles

This document outlines the fundamental security principles to be followed across all projects within the organization. Security is a non-negotiable aspect of our development process and must be considered at every stage.

## General Security Requirements

- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls throughout the application
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal access required for functionality to operate
- **Secure by Default**: All features must be secure by default, requiring explicit opt-out rather than opt-in
- **Security by Design**: Security must be considered from the earliest design stages
- **Regular Auditing**: All security components must support logging and auditing

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-factor Authentication**: MFA must be available for all user authentication flows
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce minimum complexity requirements and periodic rotation
- **Secure Session Management**: Sessions must timeout after inactivity and refresh securely
- **Role-based Access Control**: Use RBAC for all access management and permission grants
- **JWT Best Practices**: Follow industry best practices for JWT implementation including proper signing

## Data Security

- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: All PII and sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Proper Data Classification**: All data must be classified according to sensitivity level
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and retain the minimum necessary data
- **Secure Data Deletion**: Implement proper mechanisms for data deletion when requested
- **Secure Backup Strategies**: Ensure backups are encrypted and protected

## API Security

- **Input Validation**: Validate all input against strict schemas before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all public-facing endpoints
- **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS to limit access to trusted domains only
- **API Authentication**: All APIs must require proper authentication
- **Request Validation**: Validate all requests for replay attacks and tampering

## Infrastructure Security

- **WAF Implementation**: Deploy Web Application Firewall for all production environments
- **Network Segmentation**: Properly segment networks based on security zones
- **Regular Vulnerability Scanning**: Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow hardening guidelines for all infrastructure components
- **Intrusion Detection**: Implement monitoring for suspicious activities

## Third-Party Integration Security

- **Vendor Security Assessment**: Evaluate security posture of all third-party vendors
- **Secure API Keys**: Store and transmit API keys and secrets securely
- **Limited Access Scopes**: Request only necessary permissions from third-party APIs
- **Regular Audit of Integrations**: Periodically review all active integrations

## Incident Response

- **Security Incident Process**: Follow established incident response procedures
- **Communication Protocol**: Clear guidelines for communicating about security incidents
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Perform detailed analysis after security incidents
- **Remediation Plans**: Develop and implement remediation for identified issues
- **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct reviews to improve security posture

## Application Security Testing

- **SAST Integration**: Static Application Security Testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **DAST Requirements**: Dynamic Application Security Testing for critical components
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Security Code Reviews**: All security-related code must undergo security-focused code review

## Compliance Considerations

- **Regulatory Mapping**: Map security controls to relevant regulatory requirements
- **Privacy by Design**: Incorporate privacy principles into all features handling user data
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails for all security-relevant actions
- **Compliance Validation**: Regular validation of compliance with required standards
