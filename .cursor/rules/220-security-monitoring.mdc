# Security Monitoring Standards

## Context

Security monitoring is a critical component of an organization's cybersecurity posture, providing the capability to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents in a timely manner. These standards establish requirements for comprehensive security monitoring across applications, infrastructure, and data to ensure threats are detected early and addressed effectively.

## Requirements

### 1. Logging & Monitoring Architecture

1. **Centralized Logging Required**
   - All applications MUST send security-relevant logs to a centralized logging system
   - Log retention MUST adhere to legal and compliance requirements (minimum 90 days)
   - Logs MUST be stored in a tamper-evident manner to prevent unauthorized modification

2. **Security Event Collection**
   - Applications MUST log security-relevant events including:
     - Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
     - Authorization decisions (access granted and denied)
     - Administrative actions
     - Data access or modification of sensitive information
     - System and configuration changes
   - Logs MUST include essential context:
     - Timestamp (in UTC with millisecond precision)
     - Source (IP address, device ID)
     - User identity (when applicable)
     - Action performed
     - Resource affected
     - Outcome (success/failure)

3. **Log Format Standardization**
   - Security logs SHOULD follow a consistent format across applications
   - Structured logging (JSON or similar) SHOULD be used to facilitate parsing
   - Timestamps MUST use ISO 8601 format
   - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) MUST be properly masked in logs

### 2. Security Monitoring Capabilities

1. **Threat Detection Rules**
   - A comprehensive set of detection rules MUST be implemented covering:
     - Known attack patterns and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK framework)
     - Brute force and credential stuffing attacks
     - Unusual access patterns and potential data exfiltration
     - Privilege escalation and lateral movement
     - Infrastructure and configuration changes
   - Rules MUST be regularly updated based on emerging threats
   - False positive reduction strategies MUST be implemented

2. **Real-time Alerting**
   - Critical security events MUST trigger real-time alerts
   - Alerts MUST be prioritized based on risk and impact
   - Alert fatigue MUST be minimized through proper tuning and aggregation
   - Alert delivery MUST use multiple channels (email, SMS, ticketing systems)

3. **Security Dashboards**
   - Security monitoring dashboards MUST be maintained for:
     - Incident overview and trends
     - Active threats and ongoing investigations
     - Compliance status and key security metrics
   - Dashboards MUST be accessible to security personnel and other authorized stakeholders
   - Filtering and search capabilities MUST enable efficient incident investigation

### 3. Threat Detection Implementation

1. **Authentication Monitoring**
   - Systems MUST detect and alert on:
     - Multiple failed login attempts within a short period
     - Successful logins from unusual locations or devices
     - Logins outside of normal business hours (for critical systems)
     - Password resets and multi-factor authentication changes
     - Privilege escalation or role changes

2. **Network Traffic Analysis**
   - Network monitoring MUST include:
     - Unusual outbound connections or data transfers
     - Access to known malicious domains or IP addresses
     - Unexpected protocol usage or port access
     - Lateral movement between network segments
     - Unusual API usage patterns

3. **Application Behavior Monitoring**
   - Applications MUST implement monitoring for:
     - SQL injection and other injection attack attempts
     - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts
     - Unusual query patterns or high-volume requests
     - API abuse and rate limit violations
     - File upload attempts with suspicious content

4. **Infrastructure & Configuration Monitoring**
   - Systems MUST detect and alert on:
     - Unauthorized configuration changes
     - Changes to security controls or policies
     - Cloud resource provisioning or permission changes
     - Container or VM image modifications
     - Changes to network security groups or firewalls

5. **Data Access Monitoring**
   - Monitoring MUST be implemented for:
     - Access to sensitive data repositories
     - Bulk data downloads or exports
     - Data transfers to untrusted locations
     - Database schema or permission changes
     - Access pattern anomalies that may indicate data theft

### 4. Security Incident Response Integration

1. **Automated Response Capabilities**
   - Critical threats SHOULD trigger automated response actions such as:
     - Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
     - Network isolation of potentially compromised systems
     - Blocking of malicious IP addresses
     - Termination of suspicious processes or connections
   - Automated responses MUST be thoroughly tested and include safety mechanisms

2. **Incident Management Integration**
   - Security alerts MUST integrate with the organization's incident management system
   - Relevant context and evidence MUST be automatically included with alerts
   - Alert workflows MUST include escalation paths and ownership assignment
   - Incident tracking MUST maintain an audit trail of detection, investigation, and response

3. **Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - Security monitoring MUST incorporate threat intelligence feeds
   - Known indicators of compromise (IOCs) MUST be continuously monitored
   - Threat intelligence MUST be regularly updated and properly categorized
   - False positives from threat intelligence MUST be tracked and used to improve quality

### 5. Vulnerability & Patch Monitoring

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Regular automated vulnerability scanning MUST be performed on:
     - All internet-facing applications and infrastructure
     - Internal critical systems and applications
     - Third-party components and dependencies
   - Vulnerabilities MUST be prioritized based on risk, exploitability, and impact

2. **Patch Management Visibility**
   - Security monitoring MUST include visibility into patch status
   - Systems with missing critical security patches MUST be flagged
   - Patch SLAs MUST be tracked and reported on
   - Exceptions to patching requirements MUST be documented and time-limited

### 6. Security Monitoring Governance

1. **Regular Review and Testing**
   - Security monitoring capabilities MUST be tested regularly through:
     - Red team exercises and purple team activities
     - Controlled injection of suspicious activities
     - Testing of alerting channels and response procedures
     - Review of missed detections in post-incident analyses

2. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Security monitoring MUST evolve through:
     - Regular review of detection efficacy metrics
     - Incorporation of lessons learned from incidents
     - Updates based on emerging threats and attack techniques
     - Feedback from security operations personnel

3. **Documentation and Training**
   - Documentation MUST be maintained for:
     - Monitoring architecture and data flows
     - Detection rules and alerting criteria
     - Response procedures for different alert types
     - Escalation paths and contact information
   - Security operations personnel MUST receive regular training

4. **Compliance Alignment**
   - Security monitoring capabilities MUST be mapped to relevant compliance requirements
   - Evidence collection MUST support audit and investigation needs
   - Monitoring coverage MUST be regularly assessed against compliance obligations

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Security monitoring is a defense-in-depth approach that complements, but does not replace, proactive security measures.
2. Balance comprehensive monitoring with performance considerations, focusing on high-risk areas when resources are limited.
3. Consider privacy implications and legal requirements when implementing monitoring, especially for user activity.
4. Develop security monitoring capabilities incrementally, starting with the most critical systems and highest-risk threats.
5. Regularly validate monitoring effectiveness through controlled tests and attack simulations.
