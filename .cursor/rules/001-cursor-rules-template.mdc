# Enterprise Cursor Rules Format & Management

This template defines the standard format for all cursor rules in the enterprise architecture.

## Core Structure Template

```mdc
___
description: ACTION when TRIGGER to OUTCOME
globs: "file_pattern_to_match"
___

# Rule Title
- Use active title to summarize the rule purpose

## Context
- When to apply this rule
- Prerequisites or conditions
- Business justification

## Requirements
- Concise, actionable items
- Each requirement must be testable
- Clear implementation guidance

## Examples
<example>
Good concise example with explanation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Invalid concise example with explanation
</example>
```

## Rule Creation Guidelines

When creating new rules:

1. **Select the appropriate location** based on the rule's domain and purpose
2. **Follow the naming convention** with the correct prefix and descriptive name
3. **Use the standard structure** as outlined in this template
4. **Add the rule to the registry** in core/000-cursor-rules-registry.mdc
5. **Reference related rules** where appropriate

```

### Naming Convention
Rules follow the pattern: `NNN-descriptive-name.mdc` where:
- `NNN` is a numeric prefix indicating category:
  - 000-099: Core and meta rules
  - 100-199: Development standards
  - 200-299: Infrastructure and operations
  - 300-399: Testing and quality
  - 800-899: Workflows and processes
  - 900-999: Templates and examples

### Glob Pattern Examples
Common glob patterns for different rule types:
- Core standards: `**/*`
- Language-specific rules: `**/*.{js,ts}` or `src/**/*.py`
- Testing standards: `**/*.test.{js,ts}`
- React components: `src/components/**/*.tsx`
- Documentation: `docs/**/*.md`
- Configuration files: `*.config.{js,json}`
- Build artifacts: `dist/**/*`
- Multiple extensions: `src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`

## Deployment Process

When ready to use in Cursor:

1. Rules are maintained in the hierarchical enterprise structure for organization
2. The deployment script `tools/deploy_cursor_rules.sh` flattens the structure
3. Flattened rules are deployed to `.cursor/rules/` with prefixed names to maintain organization

## Relationship with Core Guidelines

This template file is specifically for:
- Creating new Cursor rules
- Updating existing Cursor rules
- Managing the rules system itself

For general development guidelines and best practices, refer to `core/000-core-guidelines.mdc`.
For a complete registry of all rules, refer to `core/000-cursor-rules-registry.mdc`.
