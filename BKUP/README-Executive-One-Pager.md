### 2. Loan Processing Functions

Our initial implementation includes these AI-accessible functions:

- **Borrower Risk Assessment**: Evaluates applicant risk profiles
- **Collateral Sufficiency Check**: Verifies collateral adequacy
- **Default Risk Calculation**: Estimates probability of loan default
- **High-Risk Industry Detection**: Identifies applications from higher-risk sectors
- **Payment Schedule Generation**: Creates payment plans based on loan terms

### 3. Secure Authentication & Bootstrap

- Enhanced login process with MCP integration
- Implemented secure token validation
- Created streamlined bootstrap process for MCP functions

## Business Benefits
