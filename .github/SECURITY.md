# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC:

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously in the LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC project, especially given its focus on financial applications and the Enterprise MCP™ framework.

### How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, please do NOT create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the Security tab in this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the private vulnerability report

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send details to: [your-security-email]
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Location** (file path, function name, line number if possible)
- **Impact assessment** (what could an attacker accomplish?)
- **Steps to reproduce** (detailed reproduction steps)
- **Proof of concept** (if you have a working exploit)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have ideas for remediation)

### Enterprise MCP™ Security Considerations

If the vulnerability affects the Enterprise MCP™ framework specifically:

- **Production impact**: How does this affect production deployments?
- **Compliance implications**: Does this affect regulatory compliance?
- **Multi-tenant concerns**: Could this affect tenant isolation?
- **Authentication/authorization**: Does this bypass security controls?

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to this timeline:

- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Fix development**: Within 1-2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

### Severity Levels

We classify vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection with data access
- Privilege escalation to admin

#### High  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of service attacks
- MCP function unauthorized access

#### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Weak cryptography
- Input validation issues

#### Low
- Security misconfigurations
- Verbose error messages
- Missing security headers
- Non-sensitive information leaks

### Security Best Practices

When using LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC in production:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Always use strong JWT secrets in production
- Implement proper role-based access control
- Enable multi-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets

#### Database Security
- Use encrypted connections to databases
- Implement proper input sanitization
- Follow principle of least privilege for database users
- Regular security audits of database access

#### MCP Function Security
- Validate all inputs to MCP functions
- Implement rate limiting for AI API calls
- Log all MCP function calls for audit trails
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns

#### Enterprise MCP™ Deployments
- Follow Enterprise MCP™ security guidelines
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Use secure configuration management
- Regular penetration testing and security assessments

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private reporting**: Security issues reported privately first
2. **Coordinated timeline**: Work with reporter on disclosure timeline
3. **Credit given**: Security researchers credited (if desired)
4. **Public disclosure**: After fixes are available and tested

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- **Prioritized**: Security fixes get highest priority
- **Clearly marked**: Security releases clearly identified
- **Backward compatible**: When possible, maintain compatibility
- **Well documented**: Clear upgrade instructions provided

### Austin AI Alliance Security

For Austin AI Alliance community members:

- **Security workshops**: Regular security training sessions
- **Code reviews**: Community security code reviews
- **Best practices**: Sharing security implementation patterns
- **Incident response**: Community support for security incidents

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we:

- **Acknowledge contributions**: Public recognition for security researchers
- **Fast response**: Prioritize security reports from the community  
- **Collaboration**: Work closely with researchers on fixes
- **Future consideration**: May implement formal bounty program as project grows

### Contact Information

- **Security Team**: [your-security-email]
- **Project Maintainer**: Greg Spehar
- **Austin AI Alliance**: Community security discussions welcome
