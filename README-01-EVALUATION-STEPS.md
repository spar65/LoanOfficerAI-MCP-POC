7. "Which farmers are at high risk of default?"
8. "Is the collateral sufficient for loan L001?"
```

_Expected: Risk scores, assessments, and recommendations_

#### 5.2.3 Advanced Analytics

```
9. "What's the crop yield risk for borrower B002 this season?"
10. "How would a 10% corn price drop affect our portfolio?"
11. "What restructuring options are available for loan L002?"
```

_Expected: Detailed analysis with specific recommendations_

### 5.3 Verify AI Integration

**Look for these indicators:**

- ✅ Natural language responses (not raw JSON)
- ✅ Specific data references (loan amounts, dates, names)
- ✅ Professional tone and formatting
- ✅ Response time < 3 seconds
- ✅ Error handling (try "invalid loan X999")

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Cannot find module 'dotenv'"

```bash
# Solution: Run bootstrap first
node bootstrap.js
```

#### "Bootstrap fails"

```bash
# Manual dependency installation
npm install
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
cd ..
```

#### "Server won't start"

```bash
# Check if port 3001 is in use
lsof -i :3001  # Mac/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :3001  # Windows

# Or run system check
npm run check
```

#### "Client won't connect"

```bash
# Ensure server is running first
# Check browser console for errors
# Try incognito/private browsing mode
```

#### "AI chatbot not responding"

- Verify OpenAI API key is configured
- Check server logs for OpenAI errors
- Try simpler queries first: "Show active loans"
- Ensure you're logged in with: john.doe / password123

#### "OpenAI API key required"

```bash
# Reconfigure API key
npm run setup
# Enter your API key when prompted
```
