## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "npm test fails completely"

```bash
# Solution 1: Check Node.js version
node --version  # Must be v16+

# Solution 2: Clean install
npm run clean
npm run install:all

# Solution 3: Manual server test
cd server && npm install && npm start
```

#### "Server won't start"

```bash
# Check if port 3001 is in use
lsof -i :3001  # Mac/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :3001  # Windows

# Kill existing process or use different port
```

#### "Client won't connect"

```bash
# Ensure server is running first
# Check browser console for errors
# Try incognito/private browsing mode
```

#### "AI chatbot not responding"

- Check server logs for OpenAI errors
- Verify test credentials: john.doe / password123
- Try simpler queries first: "Show active loans"

#### "Database errors"

- Expected behavior - system uses JSON fallback
- Check that JSON files exist in server/data/
- Database integration is optional for evaluation
