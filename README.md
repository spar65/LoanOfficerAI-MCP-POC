# Loan Officer AI - MCP Proof of Concept - Updated July 2025

A proof-of-concept application demonstrating AI-powered agricultural lending intelligence with Model Completion Protocol (MCP) integration and complete SQL Server database integration.

## Latest Updates

- **July 10, 2025**: ✅ **COMPLETE DATABASE INTEGRATION** - Eliminated all JSON dependencies, full SQL Server integration
- **July 10, 2025**: ✅ **MCP PROTOCOL FULLY OPERATIONAL** - 100% test success rate across all 16 functions
- **June 11, 2025**: Successfully sanitized repository and secured GitHub integration
- **May 30, 2025**: Enhanced logging system with comprehensive tests
- **May 19, 2025**: Added OpenAI integration with proper API key management

## What is MCP?

The Model Completion Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI models to access external data and functions:

- **Structured data retrieval**: Backend functions return standardized JSON data from SQL Server database
- **Better context management**: Functions can provide additional context to the AI model
- **Reliable AI interactions**: Eliminates AI hallucinations by providing real data

This application demonstrates how MCP can be used to create a reliable AI-powered loan officer assistant that accesses real database data through defined functions rather than making up information.

## Features

- Dashboard with agricultural loan portfolio overview
- Detailed borrower profiles with farm characteristics
- Equipment tracking with maintenance history
- AI-powered risk assessment based on payment history
- Interactive chatbot for loan officers with OpenAI integration
- Natural language processing for loan inquiries using MCP functions
- **Complete SQL Server database integration** with automatic fallback to JSON files

## How MCP Works in This Application

1. **User Login & Bootstrap**: When you log in, the application uses MCP to load initial user data from the database
2. **Chatbot Interactions**: When you ask the chatbot a question, it:
   - Analyzes your request to determine which function to call
   - Calls the appropriate MCP function on the server
   - Executes database queries to retrieve real data
   - Receives structured data back from SQL Server
   - Formulates a natural language response based on real data

For example, if you ask "What's the status of John Smith's loan?", the AI will:

- Identify this as a request for loan details
- Call the getLoanDetails MCP function with borrower="John Smith"
- Execute SQL queries against the database
- Receive actual loan data from SQL Server
- Generate a response using only the factual information provided

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC.git
   cd LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:

   The server requires configuration for OpenAI and database settings. Create a `.env` file in the server directory:

   ```
   # server/.env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development
   MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info

   # Database Configuration (SQL Server)
   USE_DATABASE=true
   DB_SERVER=localhost
   DB_NAME=LoanOfficerDB
   DB_USER=sa
   DB_PASSWORD=YourStrong@Passw0rd
   ```

   **Important**: You must obtain an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). This application uses OpenAI's function calling capability, which requires a paid API key.

3. **Set up SQL Server Database**:

   **Option A: Docker (Recommended for Mac/Linux)**:

   ```bash
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong@Passw0rd" \
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql-server \
      -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```

   **Option B: SQL Server LocalDB (Windows)**:

   ```bash
   # Use the connection string: (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and start the server**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   The server will automatically:

   - Connect to SQL Server database
   - Create database schema if needed
   - Populate with sample data
   - Fall back to JSON files if database unavailable

5. **Install dependencies and start the client** (in a new terminal):

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

7. **Login credentials**:
   - Username: john.doe
   - Password: password123

## Testing

### Running Tests

To run all tests across the entire application (both client and server):

```bash
npm test
```

To run only server tests:

```bash
npm run test:server
```

To run only client tests:

```bash
npm run test:client
```

### Test Categories

The application provides specialized test commands for different components:

```bash
# Server-side Jest tests only
npm run test:jest

# Component-specific tests
npm run test:openai     # Test OpenAI function calling integration
npm run test:logging    # Test logging and PII redaction functionality
npm run test:performance # Test API performance characteristics
npm run test:security   # Test authentication and security mechanisms

# Run all custom tests (excluding Jest tests)
npm run test:custom

# Run interactive test selection menu
npm run test:interactive
```

These test suites validate critical aspects of the application:

1. **OpenAI Tests**: Verify that OpenAI function calling works correctly, returning natural language responses based on structured data.
2. **Logging Tests**: Ensure all operations are logged appropriately with sensitive information redacted and request context propagated through the system.
3. **Performance Tests**: Measure response times, throughput, and stability under various loads.
4. **Security Tests**: Verify authentication, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

### Testing MCP Functions

The application includes specific tests for MCP functions. You can run these with:

```bash
cd server
npm run test:mcp
```

This validates that all MCP functions return the expected data structures.

## Troubleshooting

- **OpenAI API errors**: Check that your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
- **Server connection issues**: Ensure the server is running on port 3001
- **Client not connecting**: Check that the React app is running on port 3000
- **MCP function errors**: Check the server logs for detailed error information
