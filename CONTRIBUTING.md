# Contributing to LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC! This project demonstrates AI-powered agricultural lending with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project showcases how AI can revolutionize agricultural lending through:

- Real-time risk assessment
- Natural language loan processing
- Automated compliance and reporting
- Intelligent decision support systems

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC.git
   cd LoanOfficerAI-MCP-POC
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   node setup-and-test.js  # Automated setup
   ```
4. **Verify everything works**:
   ```bash
   npm test  # Should show 70+ tests passing
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations provided
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### MCP Function Development

When adding new MCP functions:

1. Add function to `server/routes/mcp-functions.js`
2. Create corresponding test in `server/tests/mcp-core/`
3. Update documentation in `README-04-CHATBOT-MCP-MAPPING.md`
4. Test with OpenAI integration

### Database Changes

- All database changes must maintain backward compatibility
- Include migration scripts for schema changes
- Test with both SQL Server and JSON fallback modes

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting PRs

```bash
npm test           # All Jest tests must pass
npm run test:mcp   # All MCP functions must work
npm run test:openai # OpenAI integration must work
```
