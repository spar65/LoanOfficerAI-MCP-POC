- `findFarmersAtRisk` - Not in registry

## üèóÔ∏è MCP Architecture Design Principles

Our implementation follows these architectural principles:

### Core Design Patterns

- **Functions First**: All operations are explicit, well-defined functions with schemas
- **Domain Orientation**: Functions grouped by business domain (loans, borrowers, risk, analytics)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic data operations enhanced with AI capabilities
- **Consistent Interfaces**: Standardized request/response format across all functions
- **Schema Validation**: Strong typing and validation for all operations

### Progressive AI Enhancement Pattern

```javascript
// Example: Functions work with or without AI
async function getBorrowerDefaultRisk(args, context) {
  const { borrowerId, useAI = true } = args;

  // Basic risk calculation (always available)
  const basicRisk = calculateBasicRisk(borrower);

  // AI enhancement (when available)
  if (useAI && aiService.isAvailable()) {
    const aiRisk = await aiService.enhanceRisk(basicRisk);
    return { ...aiRisk, ai_enhanced: true };
  }

  // Graceful fallback
  return { ...basicRisk, ai_enhanced: false };
}
```

## üöÄ Future Architecture Considerations

### MCP as a Service Protocol Benefits

- **Unified API Surface**: One consistent pattern for all service interactions
- **Schema Enforcement**: Standardized parameter validation across all operations
- **AI-Readiness**: Services designed to easily integrate AI capabilities
- **Improved Testability**: Explicit functions are easier to test than REST endpoints
- **Better Documentation**: Function definitions directly document capabilities

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Function Composition**: Build complex operations from atomic functions
2. **Real-Time Operations**: Support streaming and subscription patterns
3. **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple functions in a single request
4. **Domain-Prefixed Routing**: Organize functions by business domain
5. **Centralized Function Registry**: Maintain schemas in a central location

## üöÄ Recommendations

### Option 1: Focus on Core Functions (Recommended)

**Keep the 10 fully database-integrated functions** as the core POC demonstration:

- All basic loan operations
- All risk assessments
- All borrower operations
- Core portfolio management

### Option 2: Complete Database Integration

**Migrate the 6 JSON-based functions** to use database services:

- Create database tables for equipment, crops, market data
- Implement database methods in `mcpDatabaseService.js`
- Update function registry to use database calls

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Document the current state clearly**:

- 10 functions: Full database integration
- 6 functions: Advanced analytics using JSON data
- Total: 16 working functions ready for demonstration

## üéâ Conclusion

**The POC has 16 solid, working MCP functions with 100% chatbot coverage.**

The system is ready for demonstration with:

- **10 core functions** fully database-integrated
- **6 analytics functions** using JSON data but fully functional
- **All functions tested and working**
- **Complete chatbot interaction examples**
- **Solid architectural foundation** following MCP service protocol principles

**Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR DEMONSTRATION**
